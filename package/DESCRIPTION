Description: Entropy weighted k-means (ewkm) is a weighted subspace
        clustering algorithm that is well suited to very high
        dimensional data. Weights are calculated as the importance of a
        variable with regard to cluster membership.
        The two-level variable weighting clustering algorithm TW-k-means (twkm)
        introduces two types of weights, the weights on individual variables and
        the weights on variable groups, and they are calculated during the clustering process.
        The feature group weighted k-means (fgkm) extends this concept by grouping
        features and weighting the group in addition to weighting
        individual features.
