wskm (1.4.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support initialising ewkm with initial centers, much like kmeans

wskm (1.4.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix bug: src/ewkm.c:288: runtime error: value 1.79769e+308 is
	outside the range of representable values of type 'float'

wskm (1.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add predict.ewkm

  * Update author infos

wskm (1.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change name to be descriptive rather than non-informative.

  * Update documentation.

  * Update ewkm.c to call error() rather than printf() on errors; add two algorithms fgkm and twkm.

  * Include sum of squares data in returned value.

wskm (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change name to be descriptive rather than non-informative.

  * Update documentation.

  * Update ewkm.c to call error() rather than printf() on errors.

  * Include sum of squares data in returned value.

siatclust (1.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add new algorithm fgkm() and sample dataset fgkm.sample.

siatclust (1.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support both plot.ewkm() and levelplot.ewkm().

  * Both plot functions accept additional arguments that are passed
    through to the underlying plotters.

  * Note in ewkm.Rd that the class of the returned object is "ewkm" as
    well as "kmeans".

  * Add a "see also" to the man page for ewkm.

  * Changes suggested by Felix Andrews.

siatclust (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a generic plot to show a heatmap of the weights.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Thu, 04 Aug 2011 19:54:47 +1000

siatclust (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Simplify directory structure for the package.

  * Introduce maxrestart to control the number of restarts when there are
    fewer clusters than requested.

  * Remove empty clusters from the returned clustering, as might happen
    when fewer than the requested clusters were found and the maximum
    iteration and maximum number of restarts were reached.

  * Add tests for automated testing.

siatclust (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add some basic testing to the package: make tests.

  * Random seed functionality working in harmony with R. Thus set.seed in
    R will ensure the same model is built.

  * Previous version could return emtpy clusters. This version will
    restart the algorithm when empty clusters are encountered. The number
    of restarts is returned along with the total number of iterations.

siatclust (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
